### Fourier basis functions

Who is Fourier? [Transnational College of Lex, 2012]
![[Joseph-Fourier.jpeg]]

note: **Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier**, (born March 21, 1768, [Auxerre](https://www.britannica.com/place/Auxerre), France—died May 16, 1830, Paris), French mathematician, known also as an [Egyptologist](https://www.britannica.com/science/Egyptology) and administrator, who exerted strong influence on [mathematical physics](https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematical-physics) through his _Théorie analytique de la chaleur_ (1822; _[The Analytical Theory of Heat](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Analytical-Theory-of-Heat)_). He showed how the conduction of [heat](https://www.britannica.com/science/heat) in solid bodies may be analyzed in terms of [infinite mathematical series](https://www.britannica.com/science/infinite-series) now called by his name, the [Fourier series](https://www.britannica.com/science/Fourier-series). Far [transcending](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transcending) the particular subject of [heat conduction](https://www.britannica.com/science/thermal-conduction), his work stimulated research in mathematical physics, which has since been often identified with the solution of [boundary-value](https://www.britannica.com/science/boundary-value) problems, [encompassing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/encompassing) many natural occurrences such as [sunspots](https://www.britannica.com/science/sunspot), [tides](https://www.britannica.com/science/tide), and the [weather](https://www.britannica.com/science/weather). His work also had a great influence on the theory of functions of a real variable, one of the main branches of modern [mathematics](https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics).

### Back to basis functions ...

Fourier basis functions consist of $1$ and a series of pairs of sines and cosines of increasing frequency 
$$ 1, sin(\omega t), cos(\omega t), sin(2\omega t), cos(2\omega t), sin(3\omega t), \cos(3\omega t), \ldots$$
Fourier basis functions are used for modelling most periodic or near periodic data 
- weather data
- economic data
- HRFs
