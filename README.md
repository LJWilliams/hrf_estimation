# hrf_estimation

This is a copy of a presentation on estimating the hemodynamic response function for the fMRI Working Group.

The slides `hrf_estimation.md` were created in Obsidian using the `Advanced Slides` community plugin and the custom stylesheet `herveish.css`.

To view the slides,

clone the repository into your Obsidian vault;
install the `advanced slides` and `sliding panes` plugins from the community development section under settings (don't forget to enable them);
move the file `herveish.css` to the root `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-advanced-slides/css/` directory;
close and reopen your Obsidian vault;
open the `hrf_estmimation.md` file to view the markdown;
press the `Slide Preview` button in the left toolbar to get the slide preview;
to export click the 3 dots in the pane's toolbar and select `export to html`.
Copy your images file to wherever you have your exports saved (default is the export folder specified in your `advanced slides` settings).
click on the index file in your exports folder to open in your favourite browser. Note that Internet Explorer does not render the presentation very well.
