# hrf_estimation

This is a copy of a presentation on estimating the hemodynamic response function for the fMRI Working Group.

The slides `hrf_estimation.md` were created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) using the Advanced Slides community plugin and the custom stylesheet `herveish.css`.

To view the slides, 

1. clone the repository into your Obsidian vault;
2. install the `advanced slides` and `sliding panes` plugins from the community development section under settings (don't forget to enable them);
3. move the file `herveish.css` to the root `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-advanced-slides/css/`; 
4. Close and reopen your Obsidian vault;
5. Open the hrf_estmimation.md file to view the markdown;
6. Press the Slide Preview button in the left toolbar to get the slide preview;
7. To view in your browser, press the `View in Browser` button on the Slide Preview pane. 

Keep in mind, I have only tested using Chrome, so I don't know how well it works well with other browsers. It will not work at all with Internet Explorer. In that case, please upgrade to Edge.
